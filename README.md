Delicious Phonegap Plugins
==============================

I enjoy using [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) for mobile development, but
also need to utilize some native features on Android and iOS. This project
includes some of my base plugins that I'll utilize for other projects.

Please see the README.md in each plugin directory for instructions on how 
to add it to your project. Each plugin directory includes a sample PhoneGap
project, which should be runnable on your emulator or device. 

I am running [PhoneGap 2.5.0](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.5.0/index.html) 
and [jQuery mobile 1.3.1](http://jquerymobile.com/). I hope to try Sencha
Touch in the future, as well!
